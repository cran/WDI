\title{List of supported languages}
\usage{
languages_supported()
}
\value{
A list of fully and partially supported languages.
}
\description{
This prints two lists of languages, the fully supported ones and the locally supported ones:
* the languages in the category "fully" will return translated names and other info for all countries.
* the languages in the category "partially" will return translated names and other info only for the country they represent.
}
\details{
For example, choosing "vi" (for Vietnamese) will translate "Vietnam" in the dataset but other country names won't be translated and will be empty.
